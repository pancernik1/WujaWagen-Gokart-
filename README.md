# Indroduction to the project
## Who are we?
We are three teenagers (2x14yo and 16yo) from Poland.
## How did the project start?
During our winter break we wanted to do something productive and we all
enjoy engineering we ended up deciding to make a cheap gokart
## What are the goals?
1.Make a gokart that can take you from point A to point B. (prefferably without crashing.)
2.Learn something about engineering.
3.Have fun!
# The build
## Engine and drive train
The kart will be powered by a 7.0HP OHV Honda GX160 clone.
We will use a 19mm centrifugal clutch with a 13t gear to transfer the momentum
to a 39t gear mounted on the rear axle via a 76 segment 420 chain.
This combination will give a 3:1 final gear ratio which should result in enough power for
going uphill while also being able to reach speeds above 60km/h on straights.

## Frame 
We are currently still planning the frame layout , but what we know for sure is that we'll
use steel 30x30x3 square profiles and weld them using  a TIG welder.
## Steering & braking systems
We are still figuring out the steering , but the braking system will most likely be a drum brake 
mounted on the rear axle.
## Electronics
For now we are focusing on other parts of the kart , but in the future we plan on adding:
- a tachometer
- an electric start kit
- a 12V battery
- possibly even headlights and some sensors
